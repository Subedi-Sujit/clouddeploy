# 📌 Overview

CloudDeploy is a cloud-native task management REST API project built to demonstrate practical cloud engineering, Infrastructure as Code (IaC), containerization, AWS deployment workflows, and real-world troubleshooting.

The project started as a locally developed Flask application and was gradually deployed into AWS using:

- Docker
- Terraform
- Amazon ECS Fargate
- Amazon ECR
- Application Load Balancer (ALB)
- CloudWatch Logs

The main goal of the project was to understand the full lifecycle of deploying and operating a containerized application in the cloud, including infrastructure provisioning, networking, debugging, container orchestration, and distributed application behavior.

# 🐛 Major Problems Faced & Solutions

# ❌ Problem 1 — ECS Could Not Access AWS Services

## Error

```text
ResourceInitializationError:
unable to retrieve secret from asm
```

## Root Cause

- ECS tasks were deployed in private subnets
- NAT Gateway was disabled for cost reasons
- ECS tasks could not access:
  - Secrets Manager
  - ECR
  - CloudWatch

## Fix

For the demo deployment:

- ECS tasks moved to public subnets
- Public IPs assigned to tasks
- NAT Gateway avoided for cost optimization

Terraform change:

```hcl
subnets = var.public_subnet_ids
assign_public_ip = true
```

---

# ❌ Problem 2 — PostgreSQL Connection Failure

## Error

```text
psycopg2.OperationalError:
connection refused
```

## Root Cause

- RDS PostgreSQL was disabled for cost control
- Application still attempted PostgreSQL connection

## Fix

Implemented SQLite fallback:

```python
if db_host in ["localhost", "127.0.0.1"]:
    app.config["SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI"] = "sqlite:////tmp/clouddeploy.db"
```

---

# ❌ Problem 3 — PUT and DELETE Returned 404

## Symptoms

- GET worked
- POST worked
- PUT returned 404
- DELETE returned 404

## Root Cause

ECS was running multiple tasks.

Each task had:
- its own local SQLite database file

The Application Load Balancer routed requests between different containers.

Example:
- POST request hit container A
- PUT request hit container B
- container B did not contain the task

This became a distributed state issue.

## Fix

Reduced ECS desired count to 1:

```bash
aws ecs update-service \
  --cluster clouddeploy-cluster \
  --service clouddeploy-service \
  --desired-count 1 \
  --region ca-central-1
```

This confirmed full CRUD functionality.

# 📚 What I Learned

This project taught me:

- Infrastructure as Code with Terraform
- Docker containerization workflows
- ECS Fargate deployment lifecycle
- AWS networking fundamentals
- ALB routing behavior
- CloudWatch debugging
- Docker image lifecycle
- Distributed systems behavior
- Stateless container architecture
- Cloud cost optimization tradeoffs
- Importance of shared persistence layers in multi-container environments

---

# 💡 Production Improvements

The current deployment is intentionally cost-conscious for demo purposes.

A production-ready architecture would include:

- RDS PostgreSQL
- ECS tasks in private subnets
- NAT Gateway or VPC endpoints
- HTTPS with ACM certificates
- GitHub Actions CI/CD
- Remote Terraform backend (S3 + DynamoDB)
- ECS autoscaling
- Structured logging
- Shared production database
- Multi-task scaling

# 📜 Final Assessment

This project is not a fully enterprise-grade production platform yet, but it successfully demonstrates:

- Cloud deployment workflows
- AWS troubleshooting
- Terraform Infrastructure as Code
- Docker containerization
- ECS deployment lifecycle
- Networking and load balancing concepts
- Distributed systems awareness
- Practical cloud engineering problem-solving

The most important lesson from this project was understanding how local container state behaves in distributed environments and why production workloads require shared persistence layers such as RDS PostgreSQL instead of local container storage.
